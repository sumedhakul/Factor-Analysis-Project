# Factor-Analysis-Project
## 1. Introduction
The statistical tool used in this study, Factor Analysis. It uses the correlation structure amongst 
observed variables to model a smaller number of unobserved, latent variables known as 
factors. Factor analysis simplifies a complex dataset by taking a larger number of observed 
variables and reducing them to a smaller set of unobserved factors. It is widely employed in various 
fields, including psychology, sociology, marketing, and finance, to explore complex data 
structures and understand the underlying dimensions that influence them.
The aim of the present study was to use exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to 
investigate the factorial structure of the 14 variables which help to predict the Quality of water. 
This study opens the doors to exploiting Factor Analysis as a tool for use in the field of analyzing 
the quality of water
